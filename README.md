# Deriv Micro-Margin Bot

A browser-based, multi-strategy trading bot built for Deriv’s API. Designed for micro-margin scalping, behavioral logging, and session-level risk control. Ideal for traders, educators, and fintech teams seeking a deployable, monetizable trading engine.

## 🎯 Problem

Most retail traders burn out chasing big wins with poor discipline. They over-leverage, ignore risk, and trade emotionally—especially on mobile. There’s no structure, no behavioral logging, and no session-level control. It’s chaos disguised as hustle.

---

## 💡 Idea Proposition

What if you had a browser-based bot that trades micro-margin logic with modular signals, built-in risk caps, and session-level drawdown control? No hosting. No backend. Just plug in your Deriv token and trade with surgical precision.

---

## 🚀 Potential

- Run behavioral trading pilots with timestamped logs  
- Monetize as a token-gated SaaS for trading labs  
- Deploy in classrooms, field teams, or fintech platforms  
- Customize signal logic for your own strategies  
- Scale without infrastructure—just browser and token

This isn’t just a bot. It’s a **discipline engine**.
